# react-native-maps-draw
In the React Native map draw feature for Android, Resolved an issue that prevented drawing on the map and added a background color to the selected polygon. Additionally, I fixed a problem where the starting point was not properly connected to the ending latitude and longitude. In IOS, works as expected.
